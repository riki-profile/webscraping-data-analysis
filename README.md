## Background

### Problem Statement

The purpose of this analysis is to diversify income sources through a dropshipping business, aiming to increase monthly revenue by 10%. This initiative aligns with the goal of enhancing income through an additional occupation.

### Elaboration of the Problem Statement

**Objective:** Increase Monthly Income

To address this challenge, the analysis is guided by elaboration questions based on the `5W + 1H` framework:

- What are the potential products for dropshipping?
- How much potential income can be generated from these products?
- What is the customer persona/profile of the buyers?
- Are there variations in sales based on the source store?
- And more.

These questions may evolve as the analysis progresses.

## Data

### Data Source

The analysis utilized the `Web Scraping` method on the popular e-commerce website **Tokopedia** due to its widespread usage and high web traffic.

### Extracted Data

The following columns were extracted from the dataset:
| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| nama produk | Product names being sold |
| harga | Product prices |
| toko | Store names |
| asal | Store origins |
| rating | Product ratings |
| terjual | Quantity sold |

## Conclusion

The analysis yields several insights for the dropshipping plan aimed at enhancing monthly income:

- The dropshipping business for "seblak" products shows promise, with potential sales ranging from **Rp5,527,682 - Rp17,249,155**. If a 10% commission on net income is obtained, potential earnings could be **Rp552,768 - Rp1,724,915**. These figures align with the goal of a 10% monthly income increase (assuming a current monthly income of around 5 million).
  
- There is no apparent difference in selling price and location (Jabodetabek or non-Jabodetabek). This presents a significant opportunity, as sales won't be limited by location-based variations. A unique marketing strategy is required to attract customers, given the absence of a competitive advantage based on location.

- A weak negative correlation between price and sales is observed, though statistically insignificant. This insight could influence pricing strategy to align sales with expectations.
  
Embarking on the dropshipping of "seblak" products appears to be a suitable solution for the challenges. Careful and strategic steps based on the analysis are crucial to achieving desired goals.
